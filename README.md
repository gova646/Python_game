Cows and Bulls Game
--------------------------------------------
This is a number guessing 2 player game.
Players chise their numbers and try guessing the others number.
When player 1 guesses a number of player 2 the code computes the number of cows(that is the exact position match and number match) and number of bulls(not a positional match but a number match)
Using the cows and bulls players compete to guess the opponent number and whoever is the first to guess the opponet number.

Example:
Player1 number is 123
Player2 number is 234
PLayer1 guesses the player2 number as 123 and code gives him 2 bulls and 0 cows.
PLayer 2 guesses the player 1 number as 234 and this is a correct guess.Player 2 luckily won it in the 1st attempt.

**SETUP**

Clone the code and run main.py
